PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net light_M1_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin light_M1_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell light_M1_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net light_M1_reg[1]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin light_M1_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell light_M1_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net light_M1_reg[2]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin light_M1_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O, cell light_M1_reg[2]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net light_M2_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin light_M2_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell light_M2_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net light_MT_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin light_MT_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell light_MT_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
